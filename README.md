## 游릭 About

Coding this small typeahead search bar tool was an amusing moment! I had a great time working on this React Frontend project and implementing the functionality that provides real-time search suggestions. Overall, it was a fun project that allowed me to explore my coding skills and create something practical; It can be adapted to any database and integrated into a backend system with ease.
